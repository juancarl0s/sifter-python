# About
- This is a fork of the sifter-python wrapper written by bryanmikaelian.
- In this fork, you can send an HTML email from a GMail account with non-closed Sifter issues that have not been updated in the last 90 days (this time can be changed).
 
# How to get a list of issues you opened
1. Change the variables in email_html.py to reflect your needs (you might need to allow the app to access the sender's GMail account, see: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)
2. Make sure you're using Python 2.x, not Python 3.x
3. Run the email_html.py file
4. Listo el pollo
